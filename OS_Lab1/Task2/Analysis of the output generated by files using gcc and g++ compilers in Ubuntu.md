# Analysis of the output generated by files using gcc and g++ compilers in Ubuntu

gcc and g++ compilers are used to compile the program of c and c++ languages respectively. These compilers provide sufficient libraries to write, debug and execute the programs of c and c++ languages. Following is the step by step guide to create and write programs in gcc and g++ in Ubuntu:

------



1. **Checking whether gcc and g++ installed or not:**

2. **On terminal of Ubuntu write this command to create files:**

   ```
   touch test.c
   touch test.cpp 
   ```

3. **In the selected folder double click on the file created: **

5. **Run the commands to create the object files of source files:**

   ```
   gcc -o obj test.c
   g++ -o obj test.cpp
   ```

6. **Run the Following commands to run the object file:**

   ```
   ./obj
   ```

7. **The desired Output is as Follows:**
